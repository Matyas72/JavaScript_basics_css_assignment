        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
        lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
        environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
        them.

        <ul class="b">
            <li><span class="b">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
            a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="a">var x</span>;
            </li>
            <li><span class="b">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="a">var x = 10</span>;
            </li>
            <li><span class="b">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
            that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="a">true</span> or <span class="a">false</span>; null - <span class="a">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="a">42</span> or <span class="a">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="a">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>;
            Array - <span class="a">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span class="a">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="b">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
            values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
            conditional statements: <span class="a">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="a">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
            condition is false; <span class="a">else</span> we execute this block of code;
            </li>
            <li><span class="b">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
            an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="b">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
            instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
            screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
            tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
